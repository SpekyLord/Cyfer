## The Problem

In Philippine cities and municipalities, citizens have no reliable way to verify whether the government documents they receive — ordinances, resolutions, budget reports, contracts — are authentic and unmodified. A single official can upload, alter, or delete records without any multi-stakeholder accountability. There is no tamper-proof audit trail, and budget data is rarely accessible in an understandable form.

The result: eroded public trust, unchecked corruption, and a citizenry kept in the dark about how their tax money is spent.

---

## The Solution

**CYFER** is a blockchain-powered transparency platform built for local government units. Every document uploaded to CYFER is hashed using SHA-256 and recorded on a custom blockchain. Before any document is published publicly, it must be approved by **all designated officials** — a single rejection blocks publication. Citizens can verify any document's authenticity at any time, without needing an account.

**Core principle:** No single person controls what citizens see. Every action is permanently logged and publicly auditable.

---

## Features

### Blockchain Document Verification
Every document gets a unique SHA-256 fingerprint the moment it is uploaded. That fingerprint is stored on our custom blockchain — a cryptographically linked chain of blocks stored in Supabase. If anyone modifies the document after publication, the hash will not match, and CYFER instantly flags it as **TAMPERED**.

- Citizens can upload any government document to verify its authenticity
- Clear visual result: green **VERIFIED** or red **TAMPERED**
- No account required — fully public
- Blockchain integrity can be independently validated via `/api/blockchain/validate`

### Unanimous Consensus Protocol (UCP)
Inspired by multi-signature authorization, CYFER's UCP ensures no document reaches the public portal without 100% approval from all registered officials.

- Admin uploads a document → approval requests are automatically sent to all other admins
- Each official independently reviews and approves or rejects with an optional comment
- Document is only published when **every** official approves
- A single rejection blocks publication and logs the reason
- All approval actions are recorded on the audit trail

### AI Document Summarizer *(powered by Anthropic Claude)*
Government documents are often dense and written in legal language. CYFER uses the **Anthropic Claude API** to generate plain-language summaries that any citizen can understand.

- Click "AI Summary" on any published document
- Structured output: key points, affected parties, budget/financial implications, and a one-sentence TLDR
- Generated server-side — the API key is never exposed to the browser
- Graceful fallback if the AI service is unavailable

### Budget Transparency Dashboard
A public-facing visual dashboard showing how the municipality allocates its budget across sectors.

- Breakdown by category: Infrastructure, Health, Education, Social Services, General Administration, and more
- Bar chart visualization with percentage breakdowns
- Philippine Peso (PHP) formatting
- Admins can update budget data; changes are immediately reflected publicly

### Public Audit Trail
Every action taken on the platform is recorded in a hash-linked transaction chain — an immutable log of who did what, and when.

- Public-facing timeline of all document uploads, approvals, rejections, and verifications
- Each entry includes: action type, timestamp, official/admin reference, transaction hash
- Previous-hash linking ensures the audit trail itself cannot be tampered with
- Filter by action type

## Real-World Application

Imagine a citizen in a Philippine municipality who hears that the local government passed an ordinance raising property taxes. They want to know: *Is this document real? Was it actually approved? Who signed off on it?*

With CYFER:

1. The municipal clerk uploads the ordinance — CYFER hashes it and adds it to the blockchain
2. The mayor and treasurer each log in separately and approve it — only then does it go public
3. The citizen visits the portal, finds the ordinance, and clicks **"AI Summary"** — they instantly get a plain-language breakdown without reading 12 pages of legal text
4. Weeks later, a rumor spreads that the document was altered. The citizen downloads it and drags it into the CYFER verification tool — it comes back **VERIFIED**, hash matches exactly
5. Every step — upload, approval, verification — is permanently visible on the public audit trail

No account needed. No technical knowledge needed. Just transparency.

## Demo Credentials

The following demo accounts are pre-seeded for testing and judging:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Super Admin (Mayor) | `mayor@samplecity.gov.ph` | `DemoPassword123!` |
| Admin (Treasurer) | `treasurer@samplecity.gov.ph` | `DemoPassword123!` |
| Admin (Secretary) | `clerk@samplecity.gov.ph` | `DemoPassword123!` |

> To trigger the Unanimous Consensus Protocol, log in as each admin separately and approve the same document.

---

## How It Works

```
1. UPLOAD          2. CONSENSUS          3. VERIFY
─────────────────  ────────────────────  ──────────────────────
Admin uploads   →  All officials must  →  Citizens upload any
document.          approve (100%).        document copy.
SHA-256 hash is    Any rejection          Hash is recomputed
computed and       blocks publication.    and compared.
stored on the      Reason is logged       VERIFIED ✅ or
blockchain.        in audit trail.        TAMPERED ❌
```

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free tier)
- An [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) API key (optional — AI summarizer only)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SpekyLord/Cyfer.git
cd cyfer

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill in your Supabase URL, anon key, service role key, and Anthropic API key
```

### Database Setup

Follow the step-by-step guide in [`docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md). In summary:

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` in the SQL Editor
3. Run `supabase/policies/001_rls_policies.sql`
4. Run `supabase/seeds/001_demo_data.sql`
5. Create a public `documents` storage bucket
6. Copy your API keys to `.env.local`

### Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

CYFER directly supports Target 16.6: *"Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels."*

- **Transparency:** All published documents and budget data are publicly accessible without login
- **Accountability:** The Unanimous Consensus Protocol prevents unilateral document publishing
- **Tamper-proofing:** SHA-256 blockchain ensures citizens can always verify document authenticity
- **Accessibility:** AI summaries make complex government documents readable by all citizens

## AI Disclosure

In compliance with InterCICSkwela Hackathon rules, we disclose all AI tools used in this project:

| Tool | Purpose | How Used |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Anthropic Claude API** (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) | AI Document Summarizer | Server-side API call in `/api/summarize` — generates structured plain-language summaries of government documents for citizens |

No AI was used to replace core algorithmic logic. The blockchain, hashing, consensus protocol, and database architecture are entirely custom-built.
